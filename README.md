# RESTalk patterns

This is the source of <http://restalk-patterns.org>. You can easily edit the Markdown or asset files or add new ones. 
The SCSS sources one can be found in the `_sass` directory. The default layout can be found in the `_layouts` directory. 
The `_includes` directory contains some helper for the pattern figures to keep the Markdown files clean. 

The page is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). To run it locally you need to have Ruby 2.0.0 or higher
installed and need to execute `bundle install` and afterwards `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the web server. 
You can than goto <http://localhost:4000> to access the generated content. 
The generated content can be found in the `_site` directory.
More details for this setup can be found in the [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#step-4-build-your-local-jekyll-site) (step 2.5 and 4).
