        <h1>RESTalk – a DSL for RESTful Conversation</h1>

<p>
    RESTalk is a Domain Specific Modeling Language for visual representation of <a href="rest.html">RESTful conversations</a>. It is implemented as an extension of the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) Choreography Diagrams with REST specific details. At its current version RESTalk only supports modelling of one to one RESTful conversations. Multiparty conversations will be supported in the future. 
</p>

<p>The following figure shows an example conversation using RESTalk:</p>

<p class="text-center">
    <a href="img/notation_example.svg">
        <img class="img-medium" src="img/notation_example.svg" title="Example of a RESTalk conversation" alternate="The example conversation shows the different language elements."/>
    </a>
</p>

<p>
    The message content to be included in the client-server interaction <strong>(2)</strong> shall contain, but is not limited to, the following details: HTTP method, URI, response status code and, where applicable, links. 
</p>

<p>
    A start <strong>(1)</strong> and an end event <strong>(8)</strong> are used to depict the beginning and the end of the conversation, while the timer event <strong>(7)</strong> is used to model the response timeout due to server’s response taking too long, followed by the client resending the request. The timer can only be used attached to the request band, since it interrupts the normal request-response flow. 
</p>

<p>
    The sequence flow shows the flow of the conversation, while the hyperlink flow <strong>(3)</strong> models URIs’ discovery and usage by the client. 
</p>

<p>
The gateways are used to diverge or converge different plausible conversation paths. They can be of different kind: parallel when concurrent paths are necessary, exclusive when only one of n paths is possible <strong>(5 &amp; 6)</strong>, and inclusive when any combination of the paths can occur <strong>(4)</strong>. 
</p>

<p>A legend of RESTalk is provided in the following figure:</p>

    <a href="img/notation_horizontal.svg">
        <img src="img/notation_horizontal.svg" title="Language elements of RESTalk notation" alternate="The language elements of RESTalk: Request-Response, Alternative Server Decisions, Sequence and Hyperlink Flow, Start and End Event, Response Timeout, as well as Parallel AND, Exclusive XOR, and Inclusive OR Gateway."/>
    </a>
</p>


<h2>RESTalk optional simplifications</h2>

<p>
    To provide for the understandability of diagrams represented using RESTalk, the following simplifications and abstractions can be introduced.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Although the client can end the conversation at any time, by simply not sending further requests, we use end events to model only the paths that result in the success or failure of the initial intent of the conversation.
    </li>
    <li>
        We only show the hyperlink flow of the last received response, while in reality the link could have been obtained earlier in the conversation as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Due to the absence of consequences when resending idempotent requests, we only model the re- sending of non-idempotent requests (<code>POST</code>, <code>PATCH</code>) without emphasizing the fact that the client can eventually give up and stop resending the request.
    </li>
    <li>
        We also refrain from modeling alternative responses with 5xx status (server error) codes since they can occur after any request. 
    </li>
</ol>
